simulation of a deterministic turing machine using python.
# Turing Machine Simulator  A fully functinal **deterministic Turing Machine simulator** is implemented in python. The project demonstrates formal automate theory of through real executable python codes. --- ##  feature - custom TAPE alphabet and BLANK symbols - user-defined transition function - step-by-step simulation of machine moves - handle left and right, and a no move transitions - also supports multiple final states - clean object-oriented python designs --- ##  example of machine (Unary Increment) Input: 111 Output: 1111 --- ##  file with structure turing-machine-simulator/ │── machine.py # core turing machine engine │── README.md # project documentation --- ##  How To Run
bash
python machine.py
